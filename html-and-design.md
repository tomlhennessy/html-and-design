# Design Principles in Modern Web Design

* Introduction to Web Design Evolution
    • Over the past 30 years, web design has evolved from a niche field to a universally mainstream practice
    • The diverse population of internet users necessitates intuitive, accessible, and universally designed websites
    • Minor design flaws can alienate millions of users (e.g. poor color choices affecting those with color blindness)

* Dieter Ram's 10 Principles of Good Design:
    1. Innovative: explores new ideas and technologies
    2. Makes a Product Useful: ensures functionality is priority
    3. Aesthetic: looks good and is visually appealing
    4. Makes a Product Understandable: clear design with intuitive navigation
    5. Unobtrusive: doesn't overwhelm users; blends into their experience
    6. Honest: truthful in its purpose and design
    7. Long-lasting: avoids trends that quickly fade
    8. Thorough Down to the Last Detail: every aspect of the design is carefully thought out
    9. Environmentally Friendly: uses resources responsibly
    10. Minimal: less is more; avoids unecessary clutter

* Evolution of Modern Web Design:
    • 2007: The first iPhone revolutionised web design for mobile devices
    • Apple's Design Influence: Apple's focus on simplicity, usability, and sleek aesthetics (inspired by Dieter Rams) became the standard in the industry

* Skeumorphic vs. Flat Design:
    • Skeumorphic Design:
        - mimics real-world textures and objects to help users transition to digital interfaces
        - characterised by gradients, shadows, and detailed textures (e.g. iOS 6 icons)

    • Flat Design:
        - simplifies elements with flat colours and minimalistic outlines, focusing on clarity and usability (e.g. iOS 7 icons)
        - Moves away from unecessary visual elements to improve usability and readability

* Modern Web Design Principles:
    1. White Space:
        • Critical for readability and usability
        • Helps seperate elements on a page, preventing a cluttered look
        • Essential for mobile interfaces to avoid mis-taps and ensure legibility

    2. Colors:
        • Aesthetics: choose complentary colors that look harmonius
        • Accessibility: ensure color choices are distinguishable for color-blind users. Use tools like Adobe Color Wheel for aesthetics and color-blind simulators for accessibility testing

    3. Typography:
        • Fonts impact readability and overall aesthetic
        • Serif Fonts: good for long-form readability on low-resolution screens (e.g. Times New Roman, Georgia)
        • Sans-Serif Fonts: clean and ideal for headlines and navigation due to minimalism (e.g. Helvetica, Verdana, San Francisco)

    4. Conventions:
        • Web design conventions (e.g. hamburger menu icon for navigation) should be used consistently to meet user expectations
        • Staying updated with design trends is crucial for web developers to ensure relevant and effective designs

* Key Takeaways
    • Modern web design should prioritise simplicity, accessibility, and intuitiveness, guided by principles of minimalism and clarity
    • Understanding design evolution (from skeumorphic to flat) and key principles (white space, colors, typography) ensures effective and inclusive web experiences
    • Dieter Ram's principles remain relevant, influencing both hardware and software design with a focus on functionality, longevity and simplicity
